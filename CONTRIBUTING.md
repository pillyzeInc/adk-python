## Contribution process

### Requirement for PRs

- All PRs, other than small documentation or typo fixes, should have a Issue assoicated. If not, please create one. 
- Small, focused PRs. Keep changes minimalâ€”one concern per PR.
- For bug fixes or features, please provide logs or screenshot after the fix is applied to help reviewers better understand the fix.
- Please add corresponding testing for your code change if it's not covered by existing tests.

### Large or Complex Changes
For substantial features or architectural revisions:

- Open an Issue First: Outline your proposal, including design considerations and impact.
- Gather Feedback: Discuss with maintainers and the community to ensure alignment and avoid duplicate work

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
